Following [NCNC](https://github.com/GraphPKU/NeuralCommonNeighbor/blob/main/ogbdataset.py), we first run the scripts and generate 10 random splits of each dataset and then run the model.

To use our default split, download data from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N-mkeYjB2Bu0LXdskI3kamBv8CXNM3W3/view?usp=sharing and then unzip them into the current data folder.

If you want to generate splits from scratch, feel free to directly run the following scripts.

Then simply 
```
run_planetoid.sh
```
