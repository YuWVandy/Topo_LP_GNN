Following [NCNC](https://github.com/GraphPKU/NeuralCommonNeighbor/blob/main/ogbdataset.py), we first generate 10 random splits of each dataset, save them, and then run the model across the same splits we generate.

To reproduce the table results, please use our default split (generated by following the above NCNC scripts) that can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N-mkeYjB2Bu0LXdskI3kamBv8CXNM3W3/view?usp=sharing and then unzip them into the current data folder.

If you want to generate data splits from scratch, feel free to discard the planetoid datasets in the google drive but only unzip the edge.txt files into the current data folder and directly run the following scripts.

Then simply 
```
run_small.sh
```
